## Microservice Data Visualizer

This Python application is designed to help visualize microservice data across a posts management microservice, moderation microservice, and profile microservice using PlantUML. Currently, it reads its microservice data from hard-coded JSON files, but eventually it will include the option to use live data from these microservices.

## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub
Install the required packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application: python main.py

## Usage

Since this application reads hard-coded JSON files, you can hard-code these with data from old logs. For example, you can look in a given microservice's logs and find the JSON log with the appropriate information for each microservice. Then, you can paste them into the appropriate JSON files in this application and generate a more visual plantuml diagram.
