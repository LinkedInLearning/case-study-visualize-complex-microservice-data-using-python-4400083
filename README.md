As a software engineer, your day-to-day duties can seem like an endless to-do list, so it’s often difficult to find the time to develop new skills to grow and advance your career. How do you make an impact with your organization while also completing your core work?


In this course, Kathryn Hodge takes you through the process of coming up with an idea for an initiative, planning it, and then implementing the solution with your team.
Kathryn covers the basics of microservices and shows you how to identify and solve problems when building and using microservices. She introduces you to PlantUML, an open-source tool that helps you quickly create sequence diagrams, class diagrams, component diagrams, and more. She explains how to plan the development of a problem-solving initiative—and how to sell it to your team. Kathryn then shows you how to build a Python script to convert data into PlantUML code, how to review and refine your code, and how to demo your initiative for your team.


## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, it's recommended to use GitHub Codespaces,
2. or you can clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
